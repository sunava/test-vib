PyCRAM is the Python 3 re-implementation of [CRAM](https://cram-system.org/).
It is a toolbox for designing, implementing and deploying software on autonomous robots.

The framework provides various tools for aiding in robot software
development as well as geometric reasoning and a fast simulation mechanisms to develop
cognition-enabled control programs that achieve high levels of robot autonomy.
Other features that PyCRAM provides are: a high-level abstraction mechanism, a
plan language to structure the execution of plans, mechanisms for robot independent
code, a variety of interfaces to control a real robot, etc.


Interactive Actions and/or Examples
---
If you want to see how PyCRAM is used you can take a look at examples of different
mechanisms [here](https://pycram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

To try out the examples yourself you need to [install](https://pycram.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
PyCRAM, afterwards you can install and start Jupyter and try the [examples](https://github.com/cram2/pycram/tree/dev/examples).
